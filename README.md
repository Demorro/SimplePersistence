SimplePersistence
=================

Very simple c++ data persistence, built on PugiXML.


SimplePersistence is a persistence library for writing/reading basic data structures on disk simply, requiring very little setup or thought on the part of the programmer. It is very good for when you just want to throw something into persistent storage and read it back easily, without wasting any time messing about.
It is built on top of the excellent pugiXML library, and in actuallity is more of a utility wrapper around that than a library in its own right.


A Quick Start guide is included in the download, with installation and usage instructions.
